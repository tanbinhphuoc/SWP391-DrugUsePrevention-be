2025-07-06 10:34:09.858 +07:00 [WRN] The foreign key property 'Payment.AppointmentID1' was created in shadow state because a conflicting property with the simple name 'AppointmentID' exists in the entity type, but is either not mapped, is already used for another relationship, or is incompatible with the associated primary key type. See https://aka.ms/efcore-relationships for information on mapping relationships in EF Core.
2025-07-06 10:34:09.998 +07:00 [WRN] No store type was specified for the decimal property 'Price' on entity type 'Course'. This will cause values to be silently truncated if they do not fit in the default precision and scale. Explicitly specify the SQL server column type that can accommodate all the values in 'OnModelCreating' using 'HasColumnType', specify precision and scale using 'HasPrecision', or configure a value converter using 'HasConversion'.

2025-07-06 10:39:22.068 +07:00 [WRN] Server laptop-qlc4gki0:5764:ac9a92cf stopped non-gracefully due to Worker. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.
